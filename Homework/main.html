                <p class="first-p">
                        It was a time when pirates ruled the seas. Several bands of pirates were battling over the great hidden  <span class="text1"> treasure, One Piece, which was left by </span> <br>
                        he now legendary pirate captain, Gold Roger. There was a young boy who admired the pirates, <span class="text2">his name was [Monkey D. Luffy]</span>. One day, he mistakenly eats the devil's fruit  <br>
                        and turns himself into a rubber human being. Ten years have passed since that incident. <br>

                        <span class="text3"> Asakura Yoh </span>might look like a laid back Junior High School kid.  <br>
                        However, he is a shaman with a special ability to communicate with all the souls and spirits and possess them into his body! <br>
                   <span class="text4"> Yoh came to Funbari</span> Tokyo to make friends with all of the powerful ghosts and to become the best Shaman ever. <br>

                    His plan succeeds beyond his wildest expectations when the <span class="text5"> Death Note </span>is found by brilliant high school senior Light Yagami, who is also  <br>
                    bored with a world he considers rotten. Although initially he regards the book as a prank, Light soon  <br>
                    discovers, through <span class="text6">experimentation, that the book's claim is true</span> picture a person in your mind as you write... <br>
